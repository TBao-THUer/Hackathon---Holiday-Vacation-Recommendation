## Overview
The "Holiday Vacation Recommendation" web app helps users discover travel destinations by selecting a location and entering personal preferences. The app communicates with a FastAPI backend to generate recommendations based on the input, delivering suggestions with images and relevant details.

## Features
  * **Location Selection**: Choose a continent or country from a comprehensive list.  
  * **Custom Description Input**: Describe your ideal vacation experience to receive more tailored suggestions.  
  * **Recommendation Display**: Receive multiple destination suggestions, each with a description and accompanying image.  
  * **Dynamic Fetching**: Uses REST API to fetch recommendations based on user inputs.
  
## Demo

## Technologies Used
  * Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
  * Backend: FastAPI (Python)  
  * Machine learning: Hugging Face's `sentence-transformers` for text embeddings  
  * Database/Storage: JSON and XLSX for storing holiday destination data  

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

## Prerequisites  
  * Python 3.7+  
  * Node.js (for frontend setup if applicable)  
  * Git for cloning the repository  
  * Virtual environment (recommended for backend dependencies)  

## Installation
### 1. Clone the repository:  
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/holiday-vacation-recommendation.git  
    cd holiday-vacation-recommendation
### 2. Backend Setup:  
  * Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:  
    ```bash  
    python -m venv env  
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`  
    pip install -r requirements.txt  
   
  * Run the FastAPI server:  
    ```bash  
    uvicorn inference:app --reload  
    
### 3. Frontend Setup:  
  * Open `web.html` in your browser to launch the interface.
  * Alternatively, if using nmp or a live server.   
      ```bash
      npm install  
      npm start # or use live server extension in VSCode
